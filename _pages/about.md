Research Experience
------
Network Car-Hailing Simulation Platform (July 2021 - July 2023)
  The municipal transportation department aims to determine the optimal number of taxis and ride-hailing vehicles for the city, while ride-hailing companies are interested in exploring the impact of different ride-hailing driving logics on their fleets. To address these needs, we have developed a visual platform. This platform can output data such as the average waiting time for passengers, the average driving distance for vehicles, or any other desired metrics based on different vehicles, road networks, and passenger information.
- Backend database development
- Design of module models within the system: Passenger cancellation model, data cleaning model
- After completing the "Software Engineering" course, began to be responsible for communication with Xi'an HuiTu Co., Ltd.
- Developed the "Multi-company Design" module and wrote a paper using this module
- Paper: Will cooperation bring win-win results? -- A research on the evaluation of integrated benefits of market entities of online car-hailing (in progress, co-first author)
- Award: First Prize in the National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition for the 2021-2022 academic year
